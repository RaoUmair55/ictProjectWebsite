                            I received my new PowerRide e-bike today. Very quick delivery and
                            was straightforward to build up as there’s a link to a YouTube video
                            as well as the instructions. Great fun to ride and good quality bike
                            for the price .

                            It was a very prompt delivery, in fact, earlier than expected! It's
                            a lovely bike, and easy to build up using the instruction. A great
                            ride, and excellent for a first purchase of an electric bike.

                            I love the bike and the customer service is top-notch! I highly
                            recommend the electric bike; it is so easy to ride. If you are
                            thinking of buying one but are unsure then this is the bike and
                            company to buy it from.

                            A fantastic e-bike and really easy to set up with the instructions
                            as it’s mostly already done. I've used it a few times now to go to
                            work and back, and it has got a good battery range.
